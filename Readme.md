# Machine Learning Library for .NET (EasyML)
This solution is a successor of my ![older project](https://github.com/okozelsk/NET). 
Unlike the older solution, there is full ![**MLP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) support (many optimizers, all standard anti-overfit techniques and models). There is also implemented the [**Reservoir Computer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_computing), which is now much easier to configure and has a more powerful spike-trace predictor for time series classifications. Overall, the components are much simpler to configure and easier to use than in the older solution. 
The entire solution is written in .net 6 and consists of the main library (**EasyMLCore**) and an educational console application (**EasyMLEduApp**), where it is shown how to work with the library.


More detailed description will be aded soon.
