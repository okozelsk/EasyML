Full dataset TTOO.csv contains time series of "T2 Biosystems, Inc. (TTOO)" real daily share prices
downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTOO/history?p=TTOO.
Seven variables relate to each time point: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close and Volume.
Time-series dataset is here converted using EasyMLCore.Data.SampleDataset.LoadPatternizeAndSave method
to train (TTOO_patterns_train.csv) and test (TTOO_patterns_test.csv) part.
Converted dataset contains on each data row:
    15x3 features (High, Low, Adj Close)  =45 total input values
    followed by
    1x3 features (High, Low, Adj Close)   =3 ideal output features
The data line is therefore made up of triplets of values connected in time.
Each subsequent data row is shifted one time point into the future relative to the previous data row.
