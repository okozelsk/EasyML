Dataset contains generated Mackey Glass chaotic time series (tau=17).


Important:
Data is designed for Reservoir Computer in feeding mode = TimePoint
Necessary csv file format: the file always has the names of the values in the first
line and separate values in the following lines, where each data line represents the values
at one point in time.
