The GestureWiimote data include 10 subjects, each perform 10 gestures 10 times.
The gesture acquisition device is a Nintendo Wiimote remote controller with built-in three-axis accelerometer.
Data here is acceleration in x-axis dimension only, patterns are of different lengths and there is no missing values.

Classes at the end of datarow as number 1-10:
        1. pick-up
        2. shake
        3. one move to the right
        4. one move to the left
        5. one move to up
        6. one move to down
        7. one left circle
        8. one right circle
        9. one move toward the screen
        10. one move away from the screen
