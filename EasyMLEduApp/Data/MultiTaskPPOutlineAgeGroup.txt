This dataset was derived from original ProximalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup dataset
(see ProximalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup.txt).
In order to demonstrate the Reservoir Computer's possibility of computing several different
tasks simultaneously in RC, two additional output values were added to the original dataset.
The first is a real value calculated as the square root of the sum of the first six values
of the input vector. The second is a binary value that is true when the first value in the
input vector is greater than the eighth value.
