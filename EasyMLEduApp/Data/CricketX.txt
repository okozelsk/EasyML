The series Cricket X, Y and Z are accelerometer data (in three dimensions) taken from actors performing cricket gestures.
The twelve classes are different umpire signals: Cancel Call, Dead Ball, Four, Last Hour, Leg Bye, No Ball, One Short, Out,
Penalty Runs, Six, TV Replay, and Wide. They mounted two accelerometers orthogonal to each other, thus acceleration is measured
in 3D space. The accelerometers are housed in a small wrist watch sized enclosure worn in the form of a wrist band.
Taken together the data is a multivariate time series classification problem, but the series are not aligned so in its
current format cannot be used as such Originally used in Ko et al. "Online Context Recognition in Multisensor Systems
using Dynamic Time Warping"

Classes at the end of datarow as number 1-12:
    1: Cancel Call
    2: Dead Ball
    3: Four
    4: Last Hour
    5: Leg Bye
    6: No Ball
