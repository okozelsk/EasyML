This series of 11 classification problems were created as part of Luke Davis's PhD titled
"Predictive Modelling of Bone Ageing". They are all derived from the same images, extracted
from Cao et al. "Digital hand atlas and web-based bone age assessment: system design and
implementation". They are designed to test the efficacy of hand and bone outline detection
and whether these outlines could be helpful in bone age prediction. Algorithms to automatically
extract the hand outlines and then the outlines of three bones of the middle finger
(proximal, middle and distal phalanges) were applied to over 1300 images, and three human
evaluators labelled the output of the image outlining as correct or incorrect. This generated
three classification problems: DistalPhalanxOutlineCorrect; MiddlePhalanxOutlineCorrect; and
ProximalPhalanxOutlineCorrect. The next stage of the project was to use the outlines to predict
information about the subjects age. The three problems
{\em DistalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup, MiddlePhalanxOutlineAgeGroup and ProximalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup}
involve using the outline of one of the phalanges to predict whether the subject is one of
three age groups: 0-6 years old, 7-12 years old and 13-19 years old. Note that these problems
are aligned by subject, and hence can be treated as a multi dimensional TSC problem.
Problem Phalanges contains the concatenation of all three problems. Bone age estimation is
usually performed by an expert with an algorithm called Tanner-Whitehouse. This involves
scoring each bone into one of seven categories based on the stage of development. The final
three bone image classification problems, DistalPhalanxTW, MiddlePhalanxTW and ProximalPhalanxTW},
involve predicting the Tanner-Whitehouse score (as labelled by a human expert) from the outline.
